## Setup

Install a few dependencies with [Brew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install curl ffmpeg jq wget
```

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milhouse1337/xdio-whisper.git
cd xdio-whisper
```

Fetch [Whisper](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (as submodule), download the model and build it.

```bash
git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
cd whisper
bash ./models/download-ggml-model.sh large-v3
make
cd ..

You can now update the `.env` file in your favorite editor. 

```bash
